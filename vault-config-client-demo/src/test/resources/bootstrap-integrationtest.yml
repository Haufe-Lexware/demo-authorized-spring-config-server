spring:
  profiles:
    # If you annotate a test with @ActiveProfiles, then the annotation overrides both command line parameters and
    # the environment variable SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE. However, integration tests sometimes require special
    # configurations depending on the environment. (Yes, that's not ideal, but sometimes it cannot be helped.)
    #
    # Therefore, this file injects the profiles listed in the configuration property
    # spring.profiles.activeInTests into the active profiles.
    #
    # The "include" property expects a comma separated list of profile names. There must not be a trailing comma.
    # If activeInTests is not set, we therefore specify localconfig twice; duplicates are silently ignored.
    include: localconfig, native, ${spring.profiles.activeInTests:localconfig}
