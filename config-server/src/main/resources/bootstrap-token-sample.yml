# This file is a template for developer-specific files bootstrap-token.yml.
#
# The files specify a token that can be used to authenticate against your vault instance
# with access rights suitable for a dev environment.
#
# An administrator can issue such tokens with the following command (where USERNAME is replaced by
# the user's respective account name, obviously):
# $ vault token-create -metadata="user=USERNAME" -display-name=USERNAME-token \
#      -policy=sample-policy1 -policy=sample-policy2 -ttl="768h"
